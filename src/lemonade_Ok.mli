(** A widely spread variant of the success monad.

It is mainly useful when working with Yojson. *)

type (+'a) t =
  [ `Error of string | `Ok of 'a ]
(** The type of monads computing a value of type ['a] or failing with
    an error message. *)

include Lemonade_Type.S
    with type 'a t := 'a t

val error : string -> 'a t
(** A computation failed with the given error message. *)

val errorf : ('a, unit, string, 'b t) format4 -> 'a
(** A computation failed with the given error message, formatted by sprintf. *)

val run : 'a t -> 'a
(** [run m] return the value computed by [m] if [m] succeeded or throw
    a [Failure] exception with the given message otherwise. *)

val pp_print : (Format.formatter -> 'a -> unit) -> Format.formatter -> 'a t -> unit
(** A generic printer for monadic values. *)



(** The maybe monad transformer. *)
module T(M:Lemonade_Type.S) :
sig
  include Lemonade_Type.S
    with type 'a t = [ `Error of string | `Ok of 'a ] M.t

  val lift : 'a M.t -> 'a t
