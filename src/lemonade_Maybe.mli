val pp_print : (Format.formatter -> 'a -> unit) -> Format.formatter -> 'a option -> unit
(** A generic printer for option values. *)

val is_some : 'a option -> bool
(** Predicate recognising options containing a value. *)

val is_none : 'a option -> bool
(** Predicate recognising empty options. *)

val find : 'a option -> 'a
(** Return the value held by an option or raise [Not_found] if the
    option is empty. *)

val default : 'a -> 'a option -> 'a
(** [default val opt] return the content of [opt] or [val] if it is empty. *)

val of_list : 'a list -> 'a option
(** Return an option containing the first element of the list if any,
    or empty if the list is empty. *)

val to_list : 'a option -> 'a list
(** Return a list containing the element held by the option if any, ot

(** [filter lst] is the list of values held by the options in [lst]. *)

val filter_map : ('a -> 'b option) -> 'a list -> 'b list
(** [filter_map f lst] is the list deduced from [lst] by applying [f]
    to element of the list and retaining the values held by the list. *)
